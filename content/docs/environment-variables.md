## Config and enviroment(.env) files

Gatsby uses a standard to define [enviroment variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable) on his code.

You can provide environment variables to your site to customize its behavior in different environments. Gatsby Boilerplate offers two possible files: `.env.production` which is used to set environment variables on production and `.env.development` that can be used to set environment variables on development.

Gatsby Boilerplate uses the following environment variables:

-   `ALGOLIA_API_KEY` is used to set the API Key for [Algolia search](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/security/api-keys/) service.
-   `ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME` is used to set another one necessary Algolia credential to use the service.
-   `GA_TRACKING_ID` is used to set the tracking ID for Google Analytics track your app using `gatsby-google-analytics` plugin.
-   `GITHUB_REPO` is used to make references of a repo that have been passed to some components like Footer, Navigation...
-   `PROJECT_NAME` is used to define some titles on the page. Default value: `Gatsby Boilerplate`.
