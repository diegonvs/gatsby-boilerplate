Electric uses Marble.css as a base for his components, however, this project isn't too accessible to the community and with Liferay Cloud this CSS framework probably will be discontinued to use only Clay.css as base. Clay is a CSS framework developed by Liferay to create the company products and is backed by a great internal and community team that maintains this project. You could use another CSS framework, setting `gatsby-plugin-sass` to another CSS framework package.
