## What is Electric and Gatsby?
These platforms have been created to build static pages and help developers to create amazing websites using an established Front End architecture.

## So, what the status of this platforms?
Gatsby is maintained by a powerful community and it's made by super community-backed tools like React and GraphQL. Actually(November 2018) a lot of websites were built using this tool, check this [link](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/showcase/) for Gatsby's showcase.

Electric was maintained by Liferay using some internal tools like Metal.js and Senna.js to be a sandbox for this tools. However, Liferay had discontinued this project due to internal decisions.

> Therefore, Liferay decided to create a simple project to ease the experience to migrate a project from a discontinued project to an existing. Called [Gatsby Boilerplate](https://www.github.com/diegonvs/gatsby-boilerplate).
