## Let's start migrating content from `Tutorials` Template:

Note that Tutorials template was renamed to `Onboarding` due usage on Onboarding pages, If you didn't agree that, fill an issue.

### Changes:

frontmatter:

-   `stepNumber` frontmatter variable is a number that you can provide to order your markdown files in steps.
-   `time` frontmatter was removed because this time to read is calculated internally, however, the time to read component wasn't completed yet.
-   `buttonTitle` was removed because is unused in most of the projects.
